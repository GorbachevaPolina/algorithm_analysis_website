# Automated system for evaluating the algorithm complexity

## Description
The system is created for final qualifying work. The system accepts a file with data and completes confidence analysis of algorithm complexity. Output data - graphs of alpha, beta, left quantile of beta distribution and complexity. 

## Technologies
* React
* Redux
* Libraries: recharts, regression, simple-statistics
